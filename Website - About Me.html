        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <h1>Who am I?</h1><br>
        <p> Hello! My name is Rovelyn and I am a mother! <br><br>
            
            I am a God fearing person, kind, hard working, <br>
            strong and a fighter. I am a breast cancer <br> 
            survivor and it has been a hard fight, especially <br> 
            on how much pain I had during treatment. I have <br>
            worked in one company in Dubai for almost 23 years <br> 
            and I left the job when the pandemic started. After <br> 
            leaving, I transferred here in Abu Dhabi so that <br> 
            our family will be together. Even if I resigned <br> 
            from my work, I am still working hard. Now I'm <br> 
            able to enjoy doing different activities everyday, <br> 
            not only for maintaining my good health but making <br> 
            sure too that our family goes well day to day. <br></p>

        <h1>Skills and Hobbies</h1><br>
        <p> I have different skills and hobbies. My main skills <br>is that I love to cook as cooking is my passion. <br>
            Another skill would be computer skills as I am <br>well-versed towards using many softwares during <br>my work.<br><br>

            One of my hobbies is playing sports and that <br>is volleyball and badminton! I have taught my <br> 
            son how to play these sports and by time, he <br>managed to play these sports with me and <br>
            some of his other friends. Another hobby that <br>I learned is shooting. I achieved skills on using <br>
            an airsoft gun and a real gun and it seemed <br>really fun and it seemed nice to learn for the future.<br><br>

        <h1>Achievements</h1><br>
        <p> I have achieved many things over the years. <br> I graduated as a nursing assistant and as a <br> 
            caregiver. Another achievement is how I <br> worked in my old workplace for more than <br> 
            20 years! My dedication to my work couldn't <br>be topped off more than what I did for the <br> 
            company and for everyone working with me <br>along the way, but no other achievement <br> can be on top of acheiving to being a great mother. <br><br>
